## My process

I started bringing the design to live by laying out the structure of the html, using some semantic tags and then I created a design system in my css file using css variable to store the font families, weights, and sizes.

I also added the colors used in the design to the variable so that it will be easy to switch the different colors I needed when styling a particular component of the page.

It wasn't quite hard to get the project to look like the design but I got stuck at using JavaScript to ensure that the form had certain interactivity when a user fills the form.

It was challenging but I was able to get it to work through some colleagues that I found on Discord.

I am happy that I was able to finish up this project cause i learnt a lot, now I have an idea of what to do when working with similar projects like this.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to manipulate elements in a website using the DOM.
It added interactivity to the elements in the form.

### Continued development

The plans I have for myself as i continue this software journey are to solidify my knowledge of web languages by building more projects and then learning frameworks that make building web applications easier and then keeping on working and improving my problem solving skills as a software engineerðŸš€âœ…
